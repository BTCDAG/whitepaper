            <h2>DAG Technology Explained</h2>
            <p>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a novel technology that redefines the structural framework of blockchain
                networks. Unlike traditional blockchain, which organizes transactions in a linear sequence of blocks,
                DAG allows for a network of transactions that is not strictly sequential. This unique structure brings
                several transformative advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Scalability:</b> DAG structures can process a high volume of transactions concurrently,
                    significantly increasing the network's throughput.</li>
                <li><b>Speed:</b> The DAG network confirms transactions in parallel, which drastically reduces
                    confirmation times, making it an ideal framework for instant transactions.</li>
                <li><b>Reduced Transaction Fees:</b> Due to the efficient structure of DAG, the cost associated with
                    transaction processing is lower compared to traditional blockchain networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>BTCDAG leverages the DAG technology to overcome the limitations of conventional blockchain, such as
                scalability issues and high transaction fees. By adopting DAG, BTCDAG is not only enhancing the
